Kotlin GeoQuiz demo (question bank, instant feedback, cheat button).

This is an intentional **debug** build for demo/teaching:
- debuggable, logs intact, no minify/obfuscation
- signed with the Android debug keystore
Not for production use.

Credits: built while following *Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (5th ed.)*.
